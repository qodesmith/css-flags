# CSS Flags!

The [challenge](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/post/css-the-world-flags) was to create a variety of flags using only CSS. Here's the rules:

* CSS-only, no JS allowed (and no SVG obviously)
* Only 1 div element per flag - no children and no pseudo elements
* You are not allowed to import any external resources
* You are not allowed to have text content in your divs
* You are not allowed to use any background images via url()
* You are not allowed to use borders and shadows
* In all your generated CSS (you may use any preprocessor you wish, this applies to the compiled code), you are only allowed to have **1 background rule with 1 linear-gradient() with less than 10 stops**

I added some JavaScript with a button at the top just to be able to toggle the country names for each flag. I had to. But the design of the flags are all pure CSS.
